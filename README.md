# OpasnetUtils
OpasnetUtils is a R package for modular, open, online modelling. It uses information objects called ovariables, which have a clever indexing system with automatic interpretation and manipulation. It also enables distributed modules that are recursively fetched as needed for a model run. For examples, see http://en.opasnet.org/w/Goherr_assessment and http://en.opasnet.org/w/Helsinki_energy_decision_2015 .
